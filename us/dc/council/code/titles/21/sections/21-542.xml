    <text>If it is determined by the Commission that transporting a person who is the subject of a petition filed under <cite path="§21-541">§ 21-541</cite> for a hearing under this section poses a significant risk to the safety and wellbeing to the person, court personnel, or the public, the Commission may, upon written request from the chief of service of a hospital, the chief clinical officer of the Department of Behavioral Health or their designee, or the person's attorney, grant a continuance of the hearing. The Commission shall consider reasonable alternatives to in-person attendance, such as virtual attendance, in lieu of granting a continuance under this subsection. The continuance shall last for no longer than 48 hours and shall take into consideration the nature of the case and the specific circumstances that would warrant a continuance, which may include:</text>
